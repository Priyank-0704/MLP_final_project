# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset. The goal is to build accurate models to identify fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives.

## Features
- Imbalanced dataset handling using SMOTE and SMOTEENN.
- Autoencoder-based anomaly detection.
- Fraud classification using deep learning.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, recall).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - sklearn
  - imbalanced-learn
  - keras

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:  
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyank-0704/MLP_final_project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd final_project
3. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   fraud_detection.ipynb
## Results
The implemented deep learning model achieved:
- ROC-AUC score: 0.96
- Recall: 92%
## Future Scope
- Improve generalization by testing on other datasets.
- Explore feature importance analysis.
- Deployment strategies for real-world application.
